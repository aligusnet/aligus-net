## abs()'s issue

 abs() function ins C/C++ is not defined for minimum negative int as the standard says:

> The abs, labs, and llabs functions compute the absolute value of an integer j. If the result cannot  be represented, the behavior is undefined.

gcc returns the same value in this case.

## Heap's data structure

Heap's implementations do not have some useful functions like `change_key` or `remove_element` in many languages. E.g. in [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/make_heap/) and [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/heapq.html).


Go's implementaion actualy has both of the functions named as Fix() and Remove(): [Package heap](https://golang.org/pkg/container/heap/).

## Combining hash values

`XOR` is not always the best choice to combine hash values. E.g. for a pair of int it will always returns 0 if values are the same.

Boost uses the following approach to avoid such collisions:

```c++
template <class T>
inline void hash_combine(std::size_t& seed, const T& v)
{
    std::hash<T> hasher;
    seed ^= hasher(v) + 0x9e3779b9 + (seed<<6) + (seed>>2);
}
```

`seed` is a previous result of `hasher` or this algorithm.

Some good advices are available in [Writing a hash function in Java:
a practical guide to implementing hashCode()](https://www.javamex.com/tutorials/collections/hash_function_guidelines.shtml) (suitable not only for Java, of course).

## Facebook's ReasonML

Facebook decided to create Frankenstein: a hybrid of JavaScript and ML. It looks a bit scary to me:

```JS
// A FizzBuzz implementation in ReasonML
let fizzbuzz = (i) =>
  switch ([i mod 3, i mod 5]) {
    | [0, 0] => "FizzBuzz"
    | [0, _] => "Fizz"
    | [_, 0] => "Buzz"
    | _    => string_of_int(i)
  };

for (i in 1 to 100) {
  print_endline(fizzbuzz(i));
};
```

This piece of code taken from the article: [ReasonML - React as first intended](https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/reasonml-react-as-first-intended/).

## ML family

There are quite a few languages in ML family:

* [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_M);

* [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) - ML with Object Oriented features;

* [F#](https://fsharp.org) - better version of OCaml (IMHO);

* [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io) - OCaml's compiler to JavaScript;

* [Fable](http://fable.io) - F#'s compiler to JavaScript;

* [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) - Haskell mutated into something ML-like, compiles to JavaScript.
