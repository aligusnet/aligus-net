# Saluto

*Benvenuto nel mio sito!*

This is a sort of landing page for my open-source projects. List of them is available on [projects](/projects) page.

The site is a bunch of static pages hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), some of the pages call [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions. Therefore I can say it is an example of serverless architecture.

Though I am not really good in front-end development I tried to use some cuttind-edge front-end technologies, including [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) for client-side programming (Haskell-like lanaguage which compiles to JavaScript), [SASS language](http://sass-lang.com/) for style sheets and [Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) for HTML layout.

The site has been generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) generator.
